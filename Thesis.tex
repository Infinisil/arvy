\chapter{Introduction}

Often in computing a single resource is shared between multiple components, where only one of them may access it at a time. In a distributed setting an algorithm to solve this is called a distributed mutual exclusion algorithm or distributed directory protocol. A trivial solution is to dedicate a single node to be the center where all requests for the resource should go, with the disadvantage of a lot of traffic for many concurrent requests. Better solutions to this problem include the Arrow and Ivy protocols, both of which work on similar principles to be explained in the following sections. In the Arvy paper these protocols have been combined in a flexible manner to allow a whole set of algorithms to be created while still guaranteeing correctness.

In this thesis we explore this set of Arvy algorithms with the hope of finding ones that work better than any already existing ones

\section{Model}

We consider a complete graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n\coloneqq|V|$ vertices and $m\coloneqq\binom{n}{2}$ edges. Each edge has a cost $c : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ associated with it, representing the amount of time it takes a message to traverse it. The cost function forms a metric space:
\begin{itemize}
\item The cost from a node to itself is zero: $\forall v:c(v, v)=0$
\item Costs between different nodes are positive: $\forall u,v : u\neq v\Rightarrow c(u,v)>0$
\item Costs are the same in both directions: $\forall u,v : c(u,v)=c(v,u)$
\item Triangle inequality: $\forall u,v,w : c(u,w)\leq c(u,v)+c(v,w)$
\end{itemize}

As a reasonable constraint, a node $v$ can only query costs from itself to other nodes, so it has access to $\{c(v, u)\;|\;u\in V\}$. In a realistic scenario these costs can be obtained and updated by doing regular pings to other nodes. In our model we don't consider changing costs however.

In addition, Every node can be considered a machine with the ability to execute arbitrary effectful code such as reading/writing state or generating randomness. However execution is instantaneous, so no time passes during execution. Therefore traversing graph edges are the only place to spend time on.

A major simplification we make is that nodes can only request the token in series. So only after the token has reached the requesting node another node can make a request for it. Therefore requests can be represented as an series $r=\{r_i\},r_i\in N$ where $r_i$ encodes the $i$-th request originating from node $r_i$. For being able to reason more easily about execution time we let $i\in[1,i_{max}]$ to only have finitely many requests.

In the type of algorithms we'll look at, when the $i$-th request gets made by node $r_i$, the request travels along some path $p_i=\{p_{i0},p_{i1},\dots,p_{ip_{max}}\}$ of $p_{max}+1$ nodes \TODO{$p_{max}$ should really be ${p_{max}}_i$, better variable names?}, where $p_{i0}=r_i$ is the node making the request and $p_{ip_{max}}$ is the node currently holding the token. The token is then sent directly from $p_{ip_{max}}$ to $p_{i0}$ to satisfy the request. Without loss of generality, nodes can't send requests when they have the token already, meaning $p_{i0}\neq p_{ip_{max}}$.

The goal is to satisfy the requests most efficiently. We first define $\mathcal{C}(p_i)$ to be the cost of traversing path $p_i$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}(p_i)\coloneqq\sum_{k=1}^{p_{max}}c(p_{i(k-1)}, p_{ik})
\end{equation}

There are different ways to define efficiency in this context:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  One way is to look at the average time it takes to satisfy a request. This would include the cost to traverse the request path in addition to sending the token back. However because the cost to send the token back is unchangeable in our case we ignore it. Therefore
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_{time}(r) = \frac{1}{i_{max}}\sum_i\mathcal{C}(p_i)
  \end{equation}

  This measure is better suited for overall performance because it reflects the average request.
  
\item
  Another way is to look at how much worse the request path is than how well it could have been by getting the ratio of the actual request path to what it could have been with a direct connection.
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_{ratio}(r) = \frac{1}{i_{max}}\sum_i\frac{\mathcal{C}(p_i)}{c(p_{i0},p_{ip_{max}})}
  \end{equation}

  This measure penalizes request paths that are much longer than the direct path, so it's better suited for getting a sense of how individual requests are doing.

\item
  Even though in our model there is no execution time for computations on nodes, it could still be interesting to see how many nodes a request has to travel through. Therefore we define another measure, the average hop count:
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_{hops}(r) = \frac{1}{i_{max}}\sum_ip_{max}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section{Arrow, Ivy and Arvy}

Two well-known algorithms for solving this problem are Arrow and Ivy, which are both a special case of an Arvy algorithm, which is where its name comes from.

All of these algorithms are based on the idea of maintaining a rooted spanning tree over time: Every node stores a pointer to its parent $parent : V \rightarrow V$ while root nodes point to themselves. When a (non-root) node $a_0$ needs the token, it sends a request message towards its parent $a_1=parent(a_0)$. When a node $a_i$ receives such a request, it forwards it to $a_{i+1}=parent(a_i)$ and so on until the root $a_k$ containing the token is reached. This forms a request path $\{a_0,a_1,\dots,a_k\}$ of $k-1$ nodes. The final node then finishes its own work with the token after which it sends it directly to $a_0$. Now to make this a functioning algorithm, the arrows along this path need to be changed in some way such that the rooted tree is restored.

\subsection{Arrow}

The Arrow algorithm is the simplest way to maintain a rooted spanning tree, in that it just inverts the pointers along its path: When $a_{i+1}$ receives a request from $a_i$, it sets $parent(a_{i+1})=a_i$. See Figure~\ref{fig:arrow} for a walk-through of two requests with Arrow. Important on Arrow is that it doesn't ever change the structure of the spanning tree, meaning that the initial tree matters a lot for how well it performs.

Arrow was originally described in \cite{Ray}.

\subsection{Ivy}

Ivy encompasses an entirely different way to invert the arrows along the request path, namely that every node $a_{i+1}$ receiving the request sets its parent to the node that made the original request: $parent(a_{i+1})=a_0$. Therefore $a_0$ ends up being the center of a star consisting of all nodes along the request path. Figure~\ref{fig:ivy} shows an example of Ivy.

Ivy was originally described in \cite{Ivy}.

\subsection{Arvy}

Arvy generalizes the ideas of Arrow and Ivy by allowing nodes $a_{i+1}$ that received a request to set their parent to any node the request already traveled through, so $parent(a_{i+1})\in\{a_0,\dots,a_i\}$. See Figure~\ref{fig:arvy} for an example.

It's easy to see that this algorithm maintains a spanning tree over time with sequential requests and that it's correct. However this also holds for concurrent requests as the paper introducing Arvy~\cite{Arvy} shows.

This section describes all the Arvy algorithms to be evaluated.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Arvy algorithm}
\label{test}
\begin{algorithmic}

\Function{RequestToken}{$a_0$}
\If{$parent(a_0)\neq a_0$}
    \State send request for token to $parent(a_0)$
    \State $parent(a_0)\gets a_0$
\EndIf
\EndFunction
\Function{ReceiveRequest}{$a_k$}
\If{$parent(a_k)=a_k$}
    \State send token to $a_0$
\Else
    \State forward request to $parent(a_k)$
\EndIf
\State $parent(a_k)\gets\;$\Call{SelectNewParent}{$a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}$}
\EndFunction
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a_i\}$}
\State\Return any of $a_i$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\section{Arrow}

Arrow is a specialized version of Arvy that makes nodes along the request path always select the most recent node as a new parent
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a_i\}$}
\State\Return $a_i$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\section{Ivy}

Similarly, Ivy is a specialized version of Arvy that makes nodes along the request path always select the oldest node as a new parent, which is always the node that made the request originally
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a_i\}$}
\State\Return $a_0$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\chapter{Implementation}

Should include
\begin{itemize}
\item How the program design only allows expressing valid Arvy algorithms
\end{itemize}

As part of this thesis, a Haskell library for writing and testing Arvy algorithms was created, accessible at \url{https://github.com/infinisil/arvy}. In this chapter we explain some key design decisions that went into it. With Haskell's advanced type system it's possible to guarantee correctness of all Arvy heuristics declared with this library. Needless to say, this chapter is more technical than the others and advanced Haskell knowledge is required to fully understand it.

\section{Request Path abstraction}

An Arvy algorithm is only correct if and only if nodes can only set their new parent to nodes that were previously visited on the request path. With each node being referenced as an integer, this would be a problem, because a node $a_{n+1}$ could simply set $parent(a_{n+1})=0$ even though it might be the case that $0\notin\{a_0,\dots,a_n\}$ which would make the algorithm incorrect. So instead of representing nodes as integers, we represent them as some arbitrary type with certain capabilities that reflect them being part of the request path.

One such trivial capability we'll need is that once we have some node index, we can forward that value via messages to other nodes. This makes sense since some node $a_{n+1}$ can't know about $\{a_0,\dots,a_n\}$ unless these nodes somehow forwarded their own values along with the messages. In Haskell, this forwarding can be represented as a typeclass on two types $i_a$ and $i_b$, stating that if you have a value of $i_a$ you can get a value of $i_b$. We can implement this typeclass trivially for all types that are equal, since forwarding will then be the identity.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
-- | A class for node indices that can be forwarded between nodes
class Forwardable ia ib where
  forward :: ia -> ib

-- | All equivalent types can be trivially forwarded
instance Forwardable i i where
  forward = id
\end{minted}

Now we need to somehow encode a request path in a type. In such a request path the important constraint is that messages are only sent in one direction, meaning node indices can only be forwarded in one direction as well. Looking at it from a single node in the request path, we can forward from its predecessor to the current node and from the current node to its successor. Encoding this as a typeclass leaves us with the following for representing a node (index).

\begin{minted}{haskell}
class ( Forwardable (Pred i) i
      , Forwardable i (Succ i)
      ) => NodeIndex i where
  -- The type representing the previous node
  type Pred i :: *
  -- The type representing the successor node
  type Succ i :: *
\end{minted}

Now of course defining different types for every node along the request path is impossible, this is only used to prove correctness. So for the implementation, we can use integers to represent all nodes.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
type Node = Int

instance NodeIndex Node where
  -- Predecessors and successors in the request path are
  -- all nodes represented by integers as well
  type Pred Node = Node
  type Succ Node = Node
\end{minted}

\section{Arvy Heuristic abstraction}

The most important part of defining an Arvy algorithm is the heuristic it uses to decide the new node parent. We extend this to the notion of a behavior, which includes not only the new parents, but also how it gets decided what a request message looks like, how the initial message is generated, and what the final node receiving the message does. In fact each node on the request path should be allowed to run arbitrary code when they do the processing.

For representing computations we use the relatively new effect library \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy}{Polysemy}. In this library an computation is described with $\texttt{Sem r a}$ where $\texttt{r}$ represents the possible effects it can have and $\texttt{a}$ being the result of the computation. With this said, the main type for defining an Arvy algorithm is defined as follows.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
{- |
An Arvy heuristic for a dynamic algorithm.
- @i@ is the node index type
- @msg :: * -> *@ is the type of request messages passed between nodes,
  parametrized by the node index type for allowing messages to forward
  node indices
- @r@ is the effects the algorithm runs in, which can include effects
  parametrized by @i@ in order to allow effects dependent on indices
-}
data ArvyBehavior i msg r = ArvyBehavior
  { arvyMakeRequest :: i -> Succ i -> Sem r (msg i)
  -- ^ What message the node making the request should send to its parent
  , arvyForwardRequest :: msg (Pred i) -> i -> Succ i -> Sem r (Pred i, msg i)
  -- ^ What parent an intermediate node should select when receiving
  -- a message, and what message to forward to its parent
  , arvyReceiveRequest :: msg (Pred i) -> i -> Sem r (Pred i)
  -- ^ What parent the last node should select when receiving a message
  }
\end{minted}

This succinct-yet-complicated type includes a lot of information. The type signature of the $\texttt{arvyForwardRequest}$ function in particular is the most interesting.

For one it says that an intermediate node receives a message $\texttt{msg (Pred i)}$ that can include node indices of nodes that were predecessors to the current node. It then needs to return a value of $\texttt{Pred i}$, which represents the new parent for the node. With how node indices are defined in the previous section, the only possible values to return are ones received from the message. This means to select a new parent, nodes have to decode the message which will contain node indices given by past nodes, then return one of them.

In addition, the function receives values $\texttt{i}$ and $\texttt{Succ i}$ representing the current node index and the current nodes parent respectively. In addition to the new parent node to select, the function also needs to return a $\texttt{msg i}$ representing the message to be forwarded. The $\texttt{msg}$ type being parametrized by $\texttt{i}$ enforces that this message can only contain node indices to previous nodes (since all previous node indices $\texttt{Pred i}$ can be forwarded to $\texttt{i}$) or the current node (which is of type $\texttt{i}$ already). $\texttt{Succ i}$ however can't be sent in the message because there's no way to convert it to type $\texttt{i}$.

Functions $\texttt{arvyMakeRequest}$ and $\texttt{arvyReceiveRequest}$ are special cases of $\texttt{arvyForwardRequest}$. The former of which is special in that a node making a request does not receive any message and it doesn't need to select a new parent since it becomes the root. The latter of which is special in that the final root node receiving the request doesn't have a parent and doesn't need to forward a message.
