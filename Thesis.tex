\chapter{Introduction}

Often in computing a single resource is shared between multiple components, where only one of them may access it at a time. Components can request the resource after which they should receive it eventually. In a distributed setting an algorithm to solve this is called a distributed mutual exclusion algorithm or distributed directory protocol. A trivial solution is to dedicate a single node to be the center where all requests for the resource should go, with the disadvantage of a lot of traffic for many concurrent requests. Better solutions to this problem include the spanning tree based Arrow (also known as Raymond's algorithm) and Ivy protocols, introduced in \cite{Ray} and \cite{Ivy} respectively. The Arrow and Ivy protocols can be generalized to the Arvy algorithm, introduced in \cite{Arvy}, which allows for a wide range of different heuristics to be used for determining its behavior while still guaranteeing correctness. Other kinds of algorithms to solve this problem exist as well, such as ones based on message broadcasting or quorums.

In this thesis we come up with new Arvy heuristics and measure their empirical performance in a simulation of sequential requests.

\section{Model}
\label{model}

We consider a complete graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m=\binom{n}{2}$ edges.

\paragraph{Metric Costs} Each edge has a cost/distance $c : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ associated with it, representing the amount of time it takes a message to traverse it. Sensibly this function forms a metric space:
\begin{itemize}
\item The cost from a node to itself is zero: $\forall v:c(v, v)=0$
\item Costs between different nodes are positive: $\forall u,v : u\neq v\Rightarrow c(u,v)>0$
\item Costs are the same in both directions: $\forall u,v : c(u,v)=c(v,u)$
\item Triangle inequality: $\forall u,v,w : c(u,w)\leq c(u,v)+c(v,w)$
\end{itemize}

As a reasonable constraint, a node $v$ can only query costs from itself to other nodes, so it has access to $\{c(v, u)\;|\;u\in V\}$. In a realistic scenario these costs can be obtained and updated by doing regular pings to other nodes. In our model we don't consider changing costs however.

\paragraph{Instantaneous Computations} In addition, every node can be considered a machine with the ability to execute arbitrary effectful code such as reading/writing state or generating randomness. We model execution to be instantaneous such that no time passes for computations in nodes. Therefore traversing graph edges are the only place to spend time on.

\paragraph{Sequential Requests} A major simplification we make is that nodes can only request the token sequentially. So only after the token has reached the requesting node another node can make a request for it. Therefore requests can be represented as an series $R=\{r_1,r_2,\dots\},r_i\in V$ where $r_i$ encodes the $i$-th request originating from node $r_i$. While this series could be endless, for being able to reason more easily about execution time we let it be finite.

\paragraph{Request Paths} In the type of algorithms we'll look at, when the $i$-th request gets made by node $r_i$, the request travels along some path $A_i=\{a_i^{(0)},a_i^{(1)},\dots,a_i^{(l_i)}\}$ with $l_i=|A_i|-1$ being the index of the last node and the number of messages that are being sent. Then $a_i^{(0)}=r_i$ is the node making the request and the $a_i^{(l_i)}$ is the node currently holding the token. After the request was sent along this path, the token is then sent back directly from $a_i^{(l_i)}$ to $a_i^{(0)}$ to satisfy the request. Without loss of generality, nodes can't send requests when they have the token already, meaning $a_i^{(0)}\neq a_i^{(l_i)}$ or $|A_i|\geq 2$. In addition, it holds that $a_i^{(0)}=a_{i+1}^{(l_{i+1})}$ for all $i\in\mathbb{N}$, meaning the node making a request in a request will be the last node in the request path in the following request.

\paragraph{Performance}\label{model-perf} In order to be able to talk about performance of such algorithms, we first define $c(A_i)$ to be the cost of traversing request path $A_i$:
\begin{equation}
c(A_i)\coloneqq\sum_{k=1}^{l_i}c(a_i^{(k-1)}, a_i^{(k)})
\end{equation}

And let $c_{avg}$ be the average cost of an edge in the graph:
\begin{equation}
c_{avg}=\frac{1}{|V|^2}\sum_{u,v\in V}c(u,v)
\end{equation}

Now there are multiple reasonable ways to define performance for a sequence of requests.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Arguably the most important performance measure is the time it takes to satisfy the requests. For a single requests this includes the cost to traverse the request path as well as the cost to send the token back to the requesting node. However since the cost to send the token back does not change between different algorithms, we ignore it to get a simpler measure for comparison. In addition to normalize the costs, we divide by $c_{avg}$. To get a result over all requests $R$ we take the average over all individual requests.
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_{time}(R) = \frac{1}{|R|}\sum_{i=1}^{|R|}\frac{c(A_i)}{c_{avg}}
  \end{equation}

\item
  A different way is to look at how much worse the request paths are in comparison to a direct connection between the first and the last node in it. We again average this over all requests $R$. If after these requests the system were to be in the same state as initially, this would resemble the competitive ratio. \TODO{Look up proper definition of comp ratio in some paper}. This measure penalizes more for request paths that are much longer than the direct path, so it's better suited for getting a sense of how individual requests are doing.
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_{ratio}(R) = \frac{1}{|R|}\sum_{i=1}^{|R|}\frac{c(A_i)}{c(a_i^{(0)},a_i^{(l_i)})}
  \end{equation}

\item
  Another interesting measure is the average number of messages being sent per request. While this isn't very useful with the restrictions of instantaneous execution and sequential requests in our model, it can give us a sense of how well algorithms would do without these.
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_{hops}(r) = \frac{1}{|R|}\sum_il_i
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section{Arrow, Ivy and Arvy}

Two well-known algorithms for solving this problem are Arrow and Ivy, which are both a special case of an Arvy algorithm, which is where its name comes from.

All of these algorithms are based on the idea of maintaining a rooted spanning tree over time: Every node stores a pointer $parent : V \rightarrow V$ pointing to its parent in the tree, while the root node points to itself. When a (non-root) node $a^{(0)}$ needs the token, it sends a request message towards its parent $a^{(1)}=parent(a^{(0)})$. When a node $a^{(i)}$ receives such a request, it forwards it to $a^{(i+1)}=parent(a^{(i)})$ and so on until the root $a^{(l)}$ containing the token is reached. This forms a request path $A=\{a^{(0)},a^{(1)},\dots,a^{(l)}\}$. The final node then finishes its own work with the token after which it sends it back directly to $a^{(0)}$. Now to make this a functioning algorithm, the arrows along this path need to be inverted in some way such that the rooted tree is restored.

    { v/.style = { circle, draw } % normal graph vertices

\subsection{Arrow}
\label{intro:arrow}

The Arrow algorithm is the simplest way to maintain a rooted spanning tree, in that it just inverts the pointers along its path: When $a^{(i+1)}$ receives a request from $a^{(i)}$, it sets $parent(a^{(i+1)})=a^{(i)}$. See Figure~\ref{fig:arrow} for a walk-through of a request with Arrow. Notable with Arrow is that it doesn't ever change the structure of the spanning tree, meaning that the initial tree is crucial for its performance.

\subsection{Ivy}
\label{intro:ivy}

Ivy encompasses an entirely different way to invert the arrows along the request path, namely that every node $a^{(i+1)}$ receiving the request sets its new parent to the node that made the original request: $parent(a^{(i+1)})=a^{(0)}$. Therefore $a^{(0)}$ ends up being the center of a star consisting of all nodes along the request path. Figure~\ref{fig:ivy} shows an example of Ivy.

\subsection{Arvy}

Arvy is a class of algorithms generalizing Arrow and Ivy by allowing nodes $a^{(i+1)}$ that received a request to set their parent to any node the request already traveled through, so $parent(a^{(i+1)})\in\{a^{(0)},\dots,a^{(i)}\}$. If the last possible parent is chosen this is equivalent to Arrow, while if the earliest possible parent is chosen this is equivalent to Ivy. See Figure~\ref{fig:arvy} for an example where each node chooses a random new parent out of the available ones.

\chapter{Algorithms}

This section describes all the Arvy algorithms to be tested. A simplified version of a general algorithm can be written as follows, which we'll be using in the following sections. Note that the request path is denoted as $\{a^{(i)}\}$ as in previous sections.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Arvy algorithm}
\label{arvyalg}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{RequestToken}{$a^{(0)}$}
\Comment Node $a^{(0)}$ wants the token
\If{$parent(a^{(0)})\neq a^{(0)}$}
    \State send request for token to $parent(a^{(0)})$
    \State $parent(a^{(0)})\gets a^{(0)}$
\EndIf
\EndFunction
\Function{ReceiveRequest}{$a^{(k)}$}
\Comment Node $a^{(k)}$ receives a request for the token
\If{$parent(a^{(k)})=a^{(k)}$}
    \State send token to $a^{(0)}$
\Else
    \State forward request to $parent(a^{(k)})$
\EndIf
\State $parent(a^{(k)})\gets\;$\Call{SelectNewParent}{$a^{(0)}, a^{(1)}, \dots, a^{(k-1)}$}
\EndFunction
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a^{(0)}, a^{(1)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$}
\State\Return any of $a^{(i)}$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Any concrete algorithm will have to define an implementation of \textsc{SelectNewParent}.

\section{Arrow}

As already explained in Section~\ref{intro:arrow}, Arrow maintains the structure of the spanning tree by always selecting the most recent node as a new parent, therefore inverting the arrows.
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a_0, a_1,\dots,a_{k-1}\}$}
\State\Return $a_{k-1}$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\section{Ivy}

Also explained already in Section~\ref{intro:ivy}, Ivy always connects every node along a request path to the node that made the original request
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a_0, a_1,\dots,a_{k-1}\}$}
\State\Return $a_0$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}


\section{Uniformly Random}

Not a particularly interesting algorithm, but good as a reference point is a completely random algorithm, selecting a new parent uniformly random from all available choices.

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a_0, a_1,\dots,a_{k-1}\}$}
\State\Return $a_i$ uniformly at random
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\section{Edge Cost Minimizer}

Since algorithms have access to the edge costs, we should make use of them. A simple algorithm is one that always chooses the node with minimum edge cost as the new parent. In case there are multiple edges with the same cost, choose the last one of them. See Figure~\ref{fig:ecm} for an example. Intuitively this heuristic should perform well since short paths make for short request paths.
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a^{(0)}, a^{(1)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$}
\State\Return$a^{(i)}$ such that $c(a^{(k)},a^{(i)}),i\in\{0,\dots,k-1\}$ is minimal, use highest $i$ for tie-breaking
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

Notable properties of this algorithm include
\begin{itemize}
\item The total edge distance in the tree can only get smaller over time, since a previous edge between $a^{(k-1)}$ and $a^{(k)}$ can only be replaced with a shorter one, which will be the same edge when $c(a^{(k)},a^{(k-1)})$ is the minimum already.
\item This in turn means that with a good enough distribution of nodes initiating requests, the tree will eventually converge to a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), because that's the state of lowest possible total edge distance.
\item Consequently, once the tree has converged, this algorithm behaves exactly the same as Arrow, which never changes the tree by design. Therefore to get the eventual behavior of this algorithm, one can simply start with an MST directly and run Arrow on it. This seems to imply that in general this Algorithm isn't any more powerful than Arrow.

\section{Local Pair Distance Minimizer}

An even better measure to minimize is the total distance between all pairs of nodes in the spanning tree $T$, defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}_{pairs}(T) = \sum_{u,v\in V, u\neq v}c_T(u,v)
\end{equation}

where $c_T(u,v)$ is the cost of the shortest path between nodes $u$ and $v$ in the tree. Tree mutations aside, this directly corresponds to the performance of Arvy algorithms with uniformly random requests, since all pairs of nodes have the same probability of being used, meaning their distance in the tree contributes the same amount to the cost of an average request. In Section~\ref{tree:mpd} we discuss such minimal trees further. Notably the complexity to calculate this optimal tree is $\mathcal{O}(n^n)$, unrealistic for many nodes. In addition, nodes don't have access to a global view of the graph at runtime which is needed to calculate the minimum pair distance tree.

We can however devise an algorithm that minimizes pair distance in a local subgraph consisting of only the nodes in the request path. Specifically when node $a^{(k)}$ needs to select a new parent node out of the candidates $A=\{a^{(0)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$, it looks at the tree graph $T=(V',E')$ (with $V'\in A$ and $E'\subset V'\times V'$) of nodes in the request path that was constructed from the parent selections of all previous nodes in the path. It then selects the node $a^{(i)}$ such that selecting this node yields the lowest possible pair distance, meaning $\mathcal{C}_{pairs}(T_i)$ with $T_i=(V'\cup a^{(k)},E'\cup(a^{(i)},a^{(k)}))$ is minimal. See Figure~\ref{fig:lpm} for an example.

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a^{(0)}, a^{(1)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$}
\State\Return$a^{(i)}$ such that $\mathcal{C}_{pairs}(T_i)$ is minimal, use highest $i$ for tie-breaking
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\section{Fixed Ratio}

\paragraph{Hop-based}

Another simple algorithm is one which chooses the node at a fixed ratio $f\in[0,1]$ between the first and the last one. As an example, with a request path $a^{(0)},a^{(1)},a^{(2)},a^{(3)},a^{(4)}$ and a ratio of $f=\frac{1}{2}$, node $a^{(5)}$ would choose $a^{(2)}$ as its new parent, since it's half-way between $a^{(0)}$ and $a^{(4)}$. We use the earlier node in case of a ratio being in-between two nodes. See Figure~\ref{fig:fpr} for an example.

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a_0, a_1,\dots,a_{k-1}\}$}
\State\Return $a^{(\lfloor f\cdot(k-1)\rfloor)}$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\paragraph{Cost-based}

A possible variation of this algorithm doesn't use the fraction on the node counts, but on the edge costs instead. A request path $a^{(0)},a^{(1)},a^{(2)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}$ gets mapped to costs $c^{(i)}$ representing how far the request had to travel to get to node $a^{(i)}$. Formally these costs are defined as
\begin{equation}
c^{(i)}=\sum_{j=1}^ic(a^{(j-1)},a^{(j)})
\end{equation}

The last node whose $c^{(i)}$ is lower than or equal to $f\cdot c^{(k-1)}$ is then selected.

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a^{(0)}, a^{(1)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$}
\State\Return $a^{(i)}$ with the maximum $i$ given the constraint $c^{(i)}\leq f\cdot c^{(k-1)}$ 
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

These algorithms have the following interesting properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $f=0$ they are equivalent to Ivy. Similarly with $f=1$ they are equivalent to Arrow.
\item For $f=\frac{1}{m}, m\in\mathbb{N}$, the hop-based version builds a $m$-ary tree on the request path. See Figure~\ref{fig:fpr} for an example of it building a binary tree with $m=2$.
\item If the costs are the same for all edges, the cost-based version is equivalent to the hop-based one.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dynamic Star}

To understand the rationale behind this algorithm, we first look at the results from \cite{Peleg}, which for one is about finding a good tree to use for Arrow. A probability distribution $p_i, i\in V$ for each node making a request is given. Then the chance that a request travels from node $i$ to node $j$ is simply $p_ip_j$. Now let $d_T(u,v)$ be the cost to go from node $u$ to $v$ in some spanning tree $T$, similarly let $d_G(u,v)$ be the cost for the way from $u$ to $v$ in the whole graph $G$ by taking the shortest path. Then the expected cost of a single request in a tree and the graph respectively is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
c_R(T)\coloneqq & \sum_{u,v}p_up_vd_T(u,v) \\
c_R(G)\coloneqq & \sum_{u,v}p_up_vd_G(u,v) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Now let $T_i$ denote a shortest-path tree from node $i$, meaning a tree for which every node $j$ has a shortest path to $i$, i.e. $d_{T_i}(i,j)=d_G(i,j)$. The paper then shows that the $T_i$ with lowest $c_R(T_i)$ is a 2-approximation of the tree with lowest possible $c_R$:
\begin{equation}
c_R(T_i)\leq 2\cdot c_R(G)
\end{equation}

This means such a $T_i$ is a relatively good tree to use for Arrow, since the cost of the requests isn't much greater than the best possible path they could take. And since in our case we have a complete graph and metric costs, a shortest-path tree from node $i$ can simply be a star, connecting every other node to $i$ directly. With our complete graph weights $c(u,v)$ this then reduces the calculation of $c_R(T_i)$ to
\begin{equation}
\label{dynstarc}
c_R(T_i)=\sum_{u,v}p_up_v(c(u,i)+c(i,v))
\end{equation}

Now what this Dynamic Star algorithm does is it measures the distribution $p_i$ at runtime and dynamically adjusts the tree according to it, striving for a star. The fact that Arvy is a distributed algorithm however poses a problem, as a node can't obtain a global view of the system to get accurate values for $p_i$, so we'll have to make do with every node $v$ having a local approximation $p_i^v$ of $p_i$.

To implement this the idea is that each node $v$ maintains counts $n_i^v\in\mathbb{N}_0$ of how many times each node $i$ made a request, initialized with all $0$. Because $v$ always knows how many requests it made itself, the value for $n_v^v$ is always accurate, while all others can be an outdated value. To update $n_i^v$ the following rules are used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When node $v$ makes a request, set $n_v^v\gets n_v^v+1$
\label{rule1}
\item Any message sent from $v$ includes a subset of known counts $\{n_i^v,i\in S\subset V\}$, which when arriving at $u$ will update all received values if they are bigger than the values already known: $n_i^u\gets \max(n_i^u,n_i^v),i\in S$.
\end{enumerate}

Depending on the choice of the subset $S$ of value updates to send, the information propagation of the true values in the network might be slower or faster. Generally the bigger $|S|$, the faster information propagates. Some interesting choices for $S$ are as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item When node $v$ makes a request for the token, it only sends along its own request count with $S=\{v\}$, while all nodes along the request path use this same $S$. Since the only way for the rest of the network to know the accurate request count of the requesting node is for it to send the an updated value, this is one of the most reasonable single-element choices for $S$.
\item With every node forwarding all its values, we get With $S=V$. Propagation of values is as high as possible, but we also have $\mathcal{O}(n)$ message complexity.
\item Message size can be reduced by making $S$ a uniform random selection of $V$, with $|S|\ll|V|$. With many requests happening, information should still propagate rather quickly.
\item An improved version of this is a random weighted selection, preferring $n_i^v$ that have been updated more recently.
\end{itemize}

Once such $n_i^v$ are known, the approximated request probabilities $p_i^v$ are then simply
\begin{equation}
p_i^v=\frac{n_i^v}{\sum_jn_j^v}
\end{equation}

With this we have everything in place for the algorithm to select a new parent out of the available options $\{a^{(0)},a^{(1)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$. We do so by selecting the $a^{(i)}$ with the lowest cost as the center of the star.

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{SelectNewParent}{$\{a^{(0)}, a^{(1)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$}
\State\Return Choose $a^{(i)}$ with lowest $c_R(T_{a^{(i)}})$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

Justification is needed for the fact that the node $a_k$ selecting the new parent seems to access costs not imminent to it with the calculation of all $c_R(T_{a^{(i)}})$, which was given as a restriction in \ref{model}. This can be circumvented by each node $a^{(i)}$ calculating $c_R(T_{a^{(i)}})$ locally, which is allowed since in Formula~\ref{dynstarc} only accesses costs next the center node $a^{(i)}$. Then that value gets sent in the message to all subsequent nodes in the request path, which can use this result for the selection of the minimum. Note however that this is not exactly the same as calculating all $c_R(T_{a^{(i)}})$ values in the final node in the request path, but the resulting values shouldn't be far off.

Therefore this algorithm needs $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time for calculation of $c_R(T_i)$ in each node along the request path, making it very slow to run in comparison to other algorithms. Messages need to send $S$ and as an optimization only the $a^{(i)}$ with lowest $c_R(T_{a^{(i)}})$, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(|S|)$ message complexity.

\subsection{Non-converging Dynamic Star}

One slight problem with the Dynamic Star algorithm is that in general it eventually converges to a static tree. This is because as the total number of request grows bigger, changes to $n_i^v$ matter less and less. After $R\in\mathbb{N}$ requests, another request can cause a maximum change to $p_i^v$ of
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left|p_i^v-p_i^{'v}\right| = & \left|\frac{n_i^v}{\sum_jn_j^v}-\frac{n_i^{'v}}{\sum_jn_j^{'v}}\right| = \left|\frac{n_i^v}{R}-\frac{n_i^v+\{0,1\}}{R+1}\right| \\
= & \left|\frac{n_i^vR+n_i^v-n_i^vR+\{0,1\}R}{R(R+1)}\right| = \frac{\left|n_i^v-\{0,1\}R\right|}{R(R+1)} \\
\leq & \frac{R}{R(R+1)}=\frac{1}{R+1}\to_{R\to\infty} 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $\{0,1\}$ is $1$ or $0$ depending on whether $n_i^v$ was increased or not.

This is a problem because it means the longer a system runs, the less it's adapting to changes in the probability pattern. If after $10^{100}$ requests a request-controlling adversary shows up, it could exploit this practically static tree by constantly bouncing requests between two nodes with the worst connection. If this were to happen initially it wouldn't be a problem as the heuristic could adapt to this by choosing a better star center quickly. This means the algorithm's behavior is dependent on how long it has been running.

The general idea to solve this problem is to give less weight to older requests. This can be done in multiple ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item After every increment of $n_i^v$ by one, all counts get decreased by a constant factor: $\forall i:n_i^v\gets \alpha n_i^v$ with $0<\alpha<1$. If this was a global view this would work well, since after $R$ requests an original contribution to $n_i^{global}$ of $1$ would be reduced to $\alpha^R$, implementing an exponential weight falloff. However since this is not a global view, it won't work as well, because depending on the propagation speed with $|S|$, the $n_i^v$ will be more outdated, resulting in old requests having more weight than they would in a global view.
\item A slight improvement over this can be achieved: For each message sent from $v$, the total amount of requests known $\sum_jn_j^v$ is sent as well. When received by $u$, it's possible for it to calculate the difference of known requests $d\coloneqq\sum_jn_j^v-\sum_jn_j^u$. This means all $n_i^u$ are about that many requests more in the past than $n_i^v$, so an update is done on them to compensate for this: $\forall i:n_i^u\gets\alpha^dn_i^u$. This is better because the multiplication with $\alpha$ doesn't depend on the selection of $|S|$ anymore, resulting in older values being more accurately weighed.
\item With the requirement of nodes being able to measure passing of time, it's possible to improve on this: Every fixed time step, all counts get decreased with the constant factor $\forall i:n_i^v\gets \alpha n_i^v$. This is now a accurate time-based exponential falloff, which is independent of both the propagation speed and the request pattern.
\end{itemize}

In this thesis however we assume that the request pattern is periodic, where the problem described here isn't possible. Therefore this non-converging Dynamic Star algorithm is not further evaluated.

\section{Recursive Clique}

As we'll see in Section~\ref{result:clique}, Ivy performs well on cliques of less than 5 nodes. Taking advantage of this fact, we design a graph resembling a clique, but where each node can contain another clique within, and so on. See Figure~\ref{fig:reclique} for an example with 2 levels of cliques and each level having a clique of 3 nodes. This resulting recursive clique graph allows running Ivy recursively, taking advantage of Ivy's performance in each recursion level.

A recursive clique graph has a level count parameter $l$ representing the number of levels and a base parameter $b$ for the number of nodes in a clique on a single level. We call the $b$ nodes in all levels except the lowest one \textit{virtual}, because they only exist to group non-virtual nodes in lower levels together. The total number of nodes in such a graph is $b^l$. In addition, for defining costs between edges, we declare a parameter $f>1$ for the increase factor in edge distance between one level. This factor represents how far apart nodes in higher levels are. We define nodes in a clique in the lowest level to have distance $1$ from each other. For arbitrary nodes we can define the cost as

\begin{equation}
c(u,v)=\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if $u=v$} \\
1 & \text{otherwise if $u$ and $v$ share the same lowest level} \\
f & \text{otherwise if $u$ and $v$ share the same second-lowest level} \\
f^2 & \text{otherwise if $u$ and $v$ share the same third-lowest level} \\
\vdots & \\
f^{l-1} & \text{otherwise, $u$ and $v$ are in different nodes of the highest level} \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

When running a recursive Ivy algorithm on such a graph, the guiding rules are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The spanning tree can only include at most one connection between all virtual nodes on a single level. This ensures that if a request was made from within the virtual node where the token currently is at, the request path does not exit that virtual node. In addition this means there a request path can include at most $b-1$ edges of length $f^{l-1}$ from the most upper level (and similarly for lower levels), therefore keeping the number of long edges at a minimum.
\label{reclique-rule-conn}
\item Connect to the earliest possible node in the request path. This ensures that the inverted arrows on the request path lead future requests to the root on the fastest way possible while still satisfying rule \ref{reclique-rule-conn}. This gives Ivy-like behavior on each level and across levels.
\label{reclique-rule-early}
\end{enumerate}

See Figure~\ref{fig:reclique-alg} for an example of how this algorithm behaves with these rules.

While in this algorithm we only limit ourselves to these three parameters for simplicity, this idea can be extended much further: Each level can contain arbitrary graphs without regularity. As an example, with three nodes at the top-most level, the first node could contain a subgraph of a star, the second node a ring graph and the third node another graph containing more subgraphs for each node. This then also calls for running different Arvy algorithms on each level, using whichever works best for that levels graph, making this a very flexible approach. In a realistic scenario, the top-most level can represent different data centers around the world, the level below different racks in the data center and the level below that different machines in a rack.

\chapter{Graph Costs, Initial Trees and Request Sequences}

The performance of an Arvy algorithm depends not only on the algorithm itself, but also on the costs of the edges, the initial tree and the request sequence.

\section{Graph Costs}
\label{graph-costs}

Oftentimes an underlying non-complete graph is used to determine the costs of a complete graph by using the shortest route. In non-complete graphs without associated costs, all edges can be given a unit cost of 1.

\paragraph{Clique} This is a cost function based on an underlying graph where all nodes are connected to each other with a unit cost.
\begin{equation}
c(u,v)=
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if}\;u=v \\
1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Ring} This cost function is based on a ring with unit costs as the underlying graph.
\begin{equation}
c(u,v)\equiv|u-v|\;(\bmod\;n)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Uniformly Random Hypercube} This function models costs between uniformly random points $p_i:[0,1]^d$ in a $d$-dimensional hypercube, using the direct distance between them as the cost.
\begin{equation}
c(u,v)=\norm{p_u-p_v}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Erdős-Rényi Random Graph} Generate a non-complete graph $G'$ by connecting every possible edge with probability $p$. Then use that as the underlying graph with each edge having unit length.
\begin{equation}
c(u,v)=\text{length of shortest path from $u$ to $v$ in $G'$}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Barabási-Albert Random Graph} For an $m\in\mathbb{N}$, start with a graph $G'=(\{1,\dots,m\},\varnothing)$. Then iteratively add additional nodes while connecting it to $m$ existing nodes, with probabilities proportional to their degrees. This generates a scale-free network, where node degrees follow a power law, meaning only few nodes have high degree while many have low degree. The costs are then using this as an underlying graph. With $m=1$ this generates a tree as the underlying graph.

\begin{equation}
c(u,v)=\text{length of shortest path from $u$ to $v$ in $G'$}
\end{equation}

\section{Initial Trees}
\label{initial-trees}

\paragraph{Ring}

A tree forming a ring.

\paragraph{Minimum Spanning Tree}

The minimum spanning tree (MST) is the tree with lowest total edge cost.

\paragraph{Uniformly Random Tree}

A uniformly random tree out of all possible trees. An algorithm for generating such a tree is as follows:
\TODO{Use algorithmic}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select a random root node $r\gets_{u.a.r.}V$
\item Define $S=\{r\}$ to be the set of all nodes already included in the tree
\item Select a random node already in the tree $u\gets_{u.a.r.}S$
\label{random-tree-goto}
\item Select a random node not yet in the tree $v\gets_{u.a.r.}V\setminus S$
\item Output edge $(u,v)$ as part of the resulting tree
\item Set $S\gets S\cup\{v\}$
\item Unless $S=V$, go to step \ref{random-tree-goto}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Minimum Pair Distance Tree}
\label{tree:mpd}

This initial tree minimizes arguably most important measure for the Arrow algorithm: The average distance between all pairs of nodes. This is important because with uniformly random requests, every pair of nodes has the same chance of occurring subsequently in the request sequence. Consequently the average time to satisfy a request is the average distance between all pairs of nodes. See figure~\ref{fig:minPairDist} for example of such trees. Noticeable is that central nodes are forming and not all short edges are used.

A way to calculate this minimum is by brute force search through all possible trees. However because there are as much as $n^{n-2}$ possible trees~\cite{Borchardt} in a graph of $n$ nodes, this is not practical for more than a couple nodes. A listing of all possible trees can be obtained by the $n^{n-2}$ Prüfer~\cite{Prufer} sequences, for each of which the total pair distance needs to be found which is of order $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ (with an algorithm similar to the one described in the next paragraph), giving a total complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^n)$.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Approximated Mimimum Pair Distance}

Because calculating the actual minimum pair distance tree is impractical, we describe an algorithm that constructs a tree in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time that tries to minimize pair distance as well as possible. Let $c_{G'}(u, v)$ denote the distance of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ in a tree graph $G'=(V',E')$ of nodes $V'\subset V$ and edges $E'\subset E$. Then let $\mathcal{C}_{pairs}(G')$ denote the total distance between all pairs of nodes in $G'$.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}_{pairs}(G') = \sum_{u,v\in V'}c_{G'}(u,v)
\end{equation}

The algorithm is based on the idea of connecting nodes one-by-one to the tree, in every step choosing the node and a connecting edge that minimizes the total pair distance. We do this efficiently by maintaining a data structure that allows querying the increase of total pair distance for a node and edge in constant time.

Let $V'$ be the set of nodes currently included in the tree. $V'$ gets initialized to $\{r\}$ where $r$ is an arbitrarily chosen node. Our data structure then encompasses an array $p:V'\to\mathbb{R}$, where $p(v)$ stores the total distance from node $v$ to all other nodes $V'\setminus\{v\}$ in the current tree. In addition, a two-dimensional array $s:(V',V')\to\mathbb{R}$ is needed, where $s(u,v)$ stores the shortest distance in the tree between nodes $u$ and $v$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s(u,v)=&c_{G'}(u,v)\\
p(u)=&\sum_{i\in V'}c_{G'}(i,u) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Now if edge $(u,v)$ with $u\in V'$ and $v\in V\setminus V'$ were to get added to the tree to get $G''=G'\cup(\{v\}, \{(u,v)\})$, the total pair distance increases only by the new pairs from $v$ to all nodes in $V'$. With our data structure we can calculate this increase in constant time:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \mathcal{C}_{pairs}(G'')-\mathcal{C}_{pairs}(G') \\
=\;&\sum_{i\in V'}c_{G''}(i, v)+\sum_{i\in V'}c_{G''}(v, i)=2\sum_{i\in V'}c_{G''}(i, v) \\
=\;&2\sum_{i\in V'}\left(c_{G'}(i,u)+c(u,v)\right)=2\left(\sum_{i\in V'}c_{G'}(i,u)+|V'|\cdot c(u,v)\right) \\
=\;&2\left(p(u)+|V'|\cdot c(u,v)\right) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In addition, we can update our data structure for the new edge $(u,v)$ in linear time:
\begin{itemize}
\item To set the total distance from $v$ to all other nodes is just the total distance to all other nodes from $u$, plus the new edge once for every node: $p(v)\gets p(u)+|V'|\cdot c(u,v)$
\item For all other nodes, $p$ needs to be increased by the shortest path to $v$, which is just the shortest path to $u$ plus the cost of the edge $(u,v)$: $p(i)\gets p(i)+s(i,u)+c(u,v)$ for all $i\in V'$
\item Also the shortest path from all nodes to $v$ gets initialized to the shortest path to $u$ plus the cost of the edge $(u,v)$: $s(i,v)\gets s(i,u)+c(u,v)$ for all $i\in V'$
\item Similarly the shortest path from $v$ to all nodes: $s(v,i)\gets c(v,u)+s(u,i)$ for all $i\in V'$
\end{itemize}

As a result, our algorithm looks as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set $V'=\{r\}$ for an arbitrary node $r\in V$ and initialize $p(r)=0$ and $s(r,r)=0$
\item Add the edge $(u,v)$ ($u\in V'$ and $v\in V\setminus V'$) which increases the total pair distance by the minimum to the resulting tree
\label{approxStep}
\item Update $p$ and $s$ according to the new edge
\item Unless $V'=V$, go to step \ref{approxStep}
\end{enumerate}

Because the tree gets one more node in every iteration, the sequence of the number of edges between tree and non-tree nodes is $1n,2(n-1),3(n-2),\dots,(n-1)2,n1$. Every iteration therefore takes $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to find the best edge and an additional $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to update the data structure. The total complexity of this algorithm is therefore $\mathcal{O}(n\cdot(n^2+n))=\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.

\TODO{Go into how good this actually is?}

\chapter{Implementation Notes}

As part of this thesis, a Haskell library for writing and testing Arvy algorithms was created, accessible at \url{https://github.com/infinisil/arvy}. In this chapter we explain some key design decisions that went into it. Most notably, Haskell's advanced type system allowed guaranteeing correctness of all Arvy heuristics defined with this library. We will look at parts of the file \href{https://github.com/Infinisil/arvy/blob/1bdac2aa8e599372f2b058d26ec9c33fd53d7a72/lib/Arvy/Algorithm.hs}{$\texttt{lib/Arvy/Algorithm.hs}$} where the core of this library is defined. Needless to say, this chapter is more technical than the others and advanced Haskell knowledge is required to fully understand it.

\section{Request Path abstraction}

An Arvy algorithm is only correct if and only if nodes can only set their new parent to nodes that were previously visited on the request path. With each node being referenced as an integer, this would be a problem, because a node $a^{(k)}$ could simply set $parent(a^{(k)})=0$ even though it might be the case that $0\notin\{a^{(0)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$ which would make the algorithm incorrect. So instead of representing nodes as integers, we represent them as some arbitrary type with certain capabilities that reflect it being part of the request path.

One such trivial capability we'll need is that once we have some node index, we can forward that value via messages to other nodes. This makes sense since some node $a^{(k)}$ can't know about $\{a^{(0)},\dots,a^{(k-1)}\}$ unless these nodes somehow forwarded their own values along with the messages. In Haskell, this forwarding can be represented as a typeclass on two types $i_a$ and $i_b$, stating that if you have a value of $i_a$ you can get a value of $i_b$. We can implement this typeclass trivially for all types that are equal, since forwarding will then be the identity.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
-- | A class for node indices that can be forwarded between nodes
class Forwardable ia ib where
  forward :: ia -> ib

-- | All equivalent types can be trivially forwarded
instance Forwardable i i where
  forward = id
\end{minted}

Now we need to somehow encode a request path in a type. In such a request path the important constraint is that messages are only sent in one direction, meaning node indices can only be forwarded in one direction as well. Looking at it from a single node in the request path, we can forward from its predecessor to the current node and from the current node to its successor. Encoding this as a typeclass leaves us with the following for representing a node (index).

\begin{minted}{haskell}
class ( Forwardable (Pred i) i
      , Forwardable i (Succ i)
      ) => NodeIndex i where
  -- The type representing the previous node
  type Pred i :: *
  -- The type representing the successor node
  type Succ i :: *
\end{minted}

Now of course defining different types for every node along the request path is impossible, this is only used to prove correctness. So for the implementation, we can use integers to represent all nodes.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
type Node = Int

instance NodeIndex Node where
  -- Predecessors and successors in the request path are
  -- all nodes represented by integers as well
  type Pred Node = Node
  type Succ Node = Node
\end{minted}

\section{Arvy Heuristic abstraction}

The most important part of defining an Arvy algorithm is the heuristic it uses to decide the new node parent. We extend this to the notion of a behavior, which includes not only the new parents, but also how it gets decided what a request message looks like, how the initial message is generated, and what the final node receiving the message does. In fact each node on the request path should be allowed to run arbitrary code when they do the processing.

For representing computations we use the relatively new effect library \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy}{Polysemy}. In this library a computation is described with the type $\texttt{Sem r a}$ where $\texttt{r}$ represents the possible effects it can have and $\texttt{a}$ being the result of the computation. As an example, a computation that's allow to use randomness and returns a boolean is described by the type $\texttt{Sem '[Random] Bool}$. With this said, the main type for defining an Arvy algorithm is defined as follows.

\begin{minted}{haskell}
{- |
An Arvy heuristic for a dynamic algorithm.
- @i@ is the node index type
- @msg :: * -> *@ is the type of request messages passed between nodes,
  parametrized by the node index type for allowing messages to forward
  node indices
- @r@ is the effects the algorithm runs in, which can include effects
  parametrized by @i@ in order to allow effects dependent on indices
-}
data ArvyBehavior i msg r = ArvyBehavior
  { arvyMakeRequest :: i -> Succ i -> Sem r (msg i)
  -- ^ What message the node making the request should send to its parent
  , arvyForwardRequest :: msg (Pred i) -> i -> Succ i -> Sem r (Pred i, msg i)
  -- ^ What parent an intermediate node should select when receiving
  -- a message, and what message to forward to its parent
  , arvyReceiveRequest :: msg (Pred i) -> i -> Sem r (Pred i)
  -- ^ What parent the last node should select when receiving a message
  }
\end{minted}

This succinct-yet-complicated type includes a lot of information. When a node makes a request for the token, $\texttt{arvyMakeRequest}$ is called which generates a message to be sent to the nodes parent. Then when a message arrives at a node, depending on whether it has the token or not, the functions $\texttt{arvyReceiveRequest}$ or $\texttt{arvyForwardRequest}$ are called respectively, the latter of which then needs to generate another message for forwarding. Function $\texttt{arvyForwardRequest}$ is the most interesting one since it has to handle both receiving and sending a message, so we'll look at its type signature a bit closer.

For one it says that an intermediate node receives a message $\texttt{msg (Pred i)}$ that can include node indices of nodes that were predecessors to the current node. It then needs to return a value of $\texttt{Pred i}$, which represents the new parent for the node. With how node indices are defined in the previous section, the only possible values to return are ones received from the message. This means to select a new parent, nodes have to decode the message which will contain node indices given by past nodes, then return one of them.

In addition, the function receives values $\texttt{i}$ and $\texttt{Succ i}$ representing the current node index and the current nodes parent respectively. In addition to the new parent node to select, the function also needs to return a $\texttt{msg i}$ representing the message to be forwarded. The $\texttt{msg}$ type being parametrized by $\texttt{i}$ enforces that this message can only contain node indices to previous nodes (since all previous node indices $\texttt{Pred i}$ can be forwarded to $\texttt{i}$) or the current node (which is of type $\texttt{i}$ already). $\texttt{Succ i}$ however can't be sent in the message because there's no way to convert it to type $\texttt{i}$.

Functions $\texttt{arvyMakeRequest}$ and $\texttt{arvyReceiveRequest}$ are special cases of $\texttt{arvyForwardRequest}$. The former of which is special in that a node making a request does not receive any message and it doesn't need to select a new parent since it becomes the root. The latter of which is special in that the final root node receiving the request doesn't have a parent and doesn't need to forward a message.

\chapter{Results}

In this chapter we first look at the evaluation results from simulating different scenarios for Arvy. In each of the scenarios we have the following possible variations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of nodes. This will be in the range 100 to 10000, depending on how fast the execution of algorithms are.
\item Graph cost function. This is one of the graph costs described in Section~\ref{graph-costs}.
\item Request sequence. This will be one of the request sequences defined in Section~\ref{request-sequences}.
\end{itemize}

We then run different Arvy algorithms on such scenarios, which we can compare against each other in a single plot. In addition we specify the initial tree used for these algorithms, which can be one of the ones specified in Section~\ref{initial-trees}. The measures we will be looking at include mainly the ones described in Section~\ref{model-perf}.
