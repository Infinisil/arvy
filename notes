- Recursive clique in last special titled section. Paragraph about not a general algorithm
- Recursive clique weights last, more informal first
- Chapter 4 after 5, in appendix or so
- Get rid of small clique plots, replace with final value table
- Less mysterious
- Check out more plot for the fixed ratio thing to understand what is going on
- Check out if there's a bug with the initial average time and such
- Mention how local pair distance minimizer can be implemented with other scetion
- Better variable name for reclique f
- Move non-converging dynamic star to appendix, move end to beginning
- Remove random tree construction
- approx. thing calculation symetry
- \! \cdot \! for the n^2 analyzi
- Beginning section 5, get rid of bullet points
- Related work
  - All references about
	- Other algorithms
  - Fibonacci tree, lecture notes, website: courses -> principles of distributed computing -> shared objects, look at past emails from pankaj
	- If too short, write about the references a bit
Summary:
  - General sentence in beginning
	- No alg expls ?
	- worse worse worse
	- Investigate weirdness
